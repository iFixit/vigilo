# Vigilo
üöß Still in development üöß

Vigilo is a monitoring tool that automates Lighthouse audits and sends key metrics to Datadog. Designed to keep a vigilant eye on your web application's performance and accessibility.

### Local Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `pnpm install`
3. Run `cp lh-config.example.js lh-config.js`
4. Add the metrics you want to track to the `onlyAudits` property in the `lh-config.js` file
5. Run `pnpm run build`
6. Run `cp .env.template .env`
7. Add your Datadog API key and Datadog Application key to the `.env` file
8. Run `cp urls.example.json urls.json`
9. Add your URLs to the `urls.json` file

‚ö†Ô∏è If you are setting this up on a Windows machine via WSL, then you will need to run the following commands to ensure the correct linux dependencies are installed:
**Make sure dependencies are up to date**
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade && sudo apt -y autoremove
```
**Download and Install Chrome**
```
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo apt -y install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
```
**Check Chrome was Successfully Installed**
```
google-chrome --version
```
#### Local Usage
1. After setup, run `pnpm start` to run vigilo and send metrics to Datadog

#### Generate Dashboards in Datadog
1. After setup, run `pnpm run create-dashboard` to create temporary dashboard in Datadog.
2. Copy the newly created section in the temporary dashboard.
3. Paste it in the existing `Lighthouse Reports` dashboard.
4. Delete the temporary dashboard.

This is useful when there were changes to the config files (`lh-config.js`, and `url.json`) and we want to create the dashboards for the new `audits`/`page types`.

#### Updating Metadata of Metrics in Datadog
1. After setup, run `pnpm run update-metric-metadata` to use the CLI tool to update the metadata of the metrics in Datadog.
2. The CLI tool will give you a list of options to pass as well as information on how to use the tool.

### Docker Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `cp .env.template .env`
3. Add your Datadog API key and Datadog Application key to the `.env` file
4. Run `cp urls.example.json urls.json`
5. Add your URLs to the `urls.json` file
6. Run `cp lh-config.example.js lh-config.js`
7. Add the metrics you want to track to the `onlyAudits` property in the `lh-config.js` file
8. Run `docker build -t vigilo .`

#### Docker Usage
1. After setup, run `docker run --rm vigilo` to run vigilo and send metrics to Datadog
